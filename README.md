## Description:
At the workplace, has someone passed you an evelope with a birthday card and you draw a blank on what to say? Maybe you notice how creative Bob's note was, and you feel pressure to write something witty. Instead of agonizing over what to say or worse, just signing your name with a lame, "happy birthday", you can visit Yours Truly (yrztrly.com) for some inspiration. 

Yours Truly is a web app that maintains a database of messages for common greeting cards. It allow users to browse differ catagories and get messages they can borrow or modify to help get that card signed fast. It is a React-based app that provides authentication and users CRUD functionality (they can only delete or edit their own entries). Users must log in to get write/edit/delete access.

The following user stories were considered in planning this app:

* As a user, I want to see suggestions on what I could write in someone's card.
* As a user, I want to be able to add suggesitions to the database.
* As a user, I want to be able to upvote suggestions I like and downvote suggesions I don't (still working on this feature).
* As a user, I want to be able to log in and flag suggestions as inappropriate (still working on this feature).
* As a user, I want to be able to log in and provide a suggestion.
* As a user, I want to be able to see different suggestions based on the occasion and the relationship I have to the person.
* As an admin, I want to full CRUD access to messages (still working on this feature).
