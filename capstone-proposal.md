## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
At the workplace, has someone passed you an evelope with a birthday card and you draw a blank on what to say? Maybe you notice how creative Bob's note was, and you feel pressure to write something witty. Instead of agonizing over what to say. Or worse, just signing your name with a lame, "happy birthday". Instead, visit Yours Truly (yrztrly.com) for some inspiration. 

Yours Truly is a web app that maintains a database of messages for common greeting cards. It allow users to browse differ catagories and get messages they can borrow or modify to help get that card signed fast. With a memorable message that will make it seem like they actually care.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Users must be able to view database entries.
* Users should be able to upvote or downvote database entries
* Users should be able to flag database entries as inappropriate.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* Javascript
* React
* NPM
* HTML
* CSS
* Firebase/Firestore
* NoSQL
* Ruby/ on Rails? (if I can't get it to work with React)


## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* allow authentication for users
* allow authenticated users to add suggestions
* API call: pull up other people who have the same birthday
* API call: pull up historical events from a particular day
* pending volume of database: 
  * Make different catagories available/searchable for users (ie, serious message, funny, ambigious, birthday, anniversary, new employee, loss, etc).
  * Make different relationships available/searchable for users (ie, close friend, distant coworker/relative, spouse, etc).
* figure out how to host website on live server (AWS, Heroku, etc)

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* APIs (researching)
* Authentication (covered in class this week)
* Hosting service (researching)

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I'm a little nervous about my ability to progress without knowning more about React, but I'm sure that's a common concern.
